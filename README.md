# How to Get Unbanned on Elden Ring (2025 Guide) 🚀

Getting banned from Elden Ring can feel like falling into a pit of despair—especially if you’re convinced it was all a big misunderstanding. Don’t worry! This simple guide will help you figure out what to do if you’ve been banned, and how to appeal your ban for the best chance at reclaiming your precious Soul Level.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you try hopping back into Elden Ring with a fresh account only to get booted again? Or maybe your ban is haunting every new character you make? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! That means FromSoftware has flagged your PC’s hardware, making it impossible to play—even with a brand new account.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check any emails or notifications from FromSoftware or Steam to uncover the reason behind your ban. Common ban triggers include:  
- Cheating or using unauthorized mods/hacks  
- Exploiting glitches or game-breaking bugs  
- Harassment, toxic behavior, or violating the code of conduct  

**Pro tip:** Always brush up on FromSoftware’s Terms of Service before firing off an appeal.
